a driving test, the examiner critically assesses the candidate's driving, noting\
every mistake, large or small, made by the driver under test. The examiner takes\
the driver through a route which tests many possible driving activities, such as\
road junctions of different types, control and maneuvering of the car, ability to\
stop safely in an emergency, and awareness of the road, other road users and\
hazards. Some of the activities must be tested. For example, in the UK, an\
emergency stop test is always carried out, with the examiner simulating the\
moment of emergency by hitting the dashboard at which point the driver must\
stop the car quickly, safely and without loss of control. At the end of the test,\
the examiner makes a judgment about the driver's performance. Has the driver\
passed the test or failed? The examiner bases the judgment on the number and\
severity of the failures identified, and also whether the driver has been able to\
meet the driving requirements. A single severe fault is enough to fail the whole\
test, but a small number of minor faults might still mean the test is passed.\
Many minor faults would reduce the confidence of the examiner in the quality\
—of the driving to the point where the driver cannot pass.";
