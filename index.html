              <div id="content">We have spent some time describing why we need to test, but we have not discussed
what testing is. What do we mean by the word testing? We use the words
test and testing in everyday life and earlier we said testing could be described as
'checking the software is OK'. That is not a detailed enough definition to help
us understand software testing. Let's use an analogy to help us: driving tests. In
a driving test, the examiner critically assesses the candidate's driving, noting
every mistake, large or small, made by the driver under test. The examiner takes
the driver through a route which tests many possible driving activities, such as
road junctions of different types, control and maneuvering of the car, ability to
stop safely in an emergency, and awareness of the road, other road users and
hazards. Some of the activities must be tested. For example, in the UK, an
emergency stop test is always carried out, with the examiner simulating the
moment of emergency by hitting the dashboard at which point the driver must
stop the car quickly, safely and without loss of control. At the end of the test,
the examiner makes a judgment about the driver's performance. Has the driver
passed the test or failed? The examiner bases the judgment on the number and
severity of the failures identified, and also whether the driver has been able to
meet the driving requirements. A single severe fault is enough to fail the whole
test, but a small number of minor faults might still mean the test is passed.
Many minor faults would reduce the confidence of the examiner in the quality
â€”of the driving to the point where the driver cannot pass.</div>
